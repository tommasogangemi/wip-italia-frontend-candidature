To inspect the project please clone the repository and open the "index.html" file in your browser.

The project was built using vanilla html and Javascript and styled using SCSS.
If you wish to contribute and/or update the project my advice is to use Visual Studio Code and the "Live Sass Compiler" extension to write the SCSS and get it compiled into CSS.

Enjoy!
